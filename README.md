# OBS-Scanline-Emulator-Shader
A shader for obs-shaderfilter that emulates how a CRT electron gun moves.

Can do both interlaced and progressive scanning.

Compared to other scanline filters/shaders this one not only creates horizontal lines but it also tracks the "beam"'s horizontal movement on each line.
Strives more for accuracy rather than looking good.
